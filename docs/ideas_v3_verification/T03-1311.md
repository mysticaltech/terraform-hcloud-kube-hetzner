# T03 / Discussion #1311 Verification

Status: already implemented in `origin/staging`.

## Evidence
- `variables.tf` defines `robot_user` and `robot_password`.
- `locals.tf` includes both values in `kube_system_secrets` when Robot CCM is enabled.
- `templates/kube_system_secrets.yaml.tpl` renders `kube_system_secrets` entries into Kubernetes secrets.

## Notes
No additional code changes were required for this discussion objective.
