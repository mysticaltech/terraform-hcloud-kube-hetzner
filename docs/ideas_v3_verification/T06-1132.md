# T06 / Discussion #1132 Verification

Status: already implemented in `origin/staging`.

## Evidence
- `variables.tf` exposes `kubernetes_distribution_type` with validation for `k3s` and `rke2`.
- `locals.tf` derives `kubernetes_distribution` and contains distribution-specific install/service paths.
- `modules/host/templates/cloudinit.yaml.tpl` and root module provisioning paths support distribution-aware behavior.

## Notes
The objective is present under `kubernetes_distribution_type` naming.
