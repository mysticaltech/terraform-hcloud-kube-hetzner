# T28 / Discussion #911 Verification

Status: already implemented in `origin/staging`.

## Evidence
- `variables.tf` defines `cilium_routing_mode` with validation (`tunnel` or `native`).
- `variables.tf` defines `cilium_ipv4_native_routing_cidr`.
- `locals.tf` contains Cilium routing settings consumed by rendered values.

## Notes
No further code changes were required for this objective.
