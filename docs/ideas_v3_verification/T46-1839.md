# T46 / Discussion #1839 Verification

Status: already implemented in `origin/staging`.

## Evidence
- `variables.tf` includes `longhorn_volume_size` and `longhorn_mount_path` in control plane and agent nodepool schemas.
- `variables.tf` includes validation rules for `longhorn_mount_path`.
- `locals.tf` propagates `longhorn_volume_size` and `longhorn_mount_path` into rendered node pool objects.

## Notes
No additional code changes were required for this verification task.
